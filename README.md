# Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm and Heuristic

## Overview

This is a Python implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, featuring an unbeatable AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with a heuristic evaluation function.

## Features

- Play against a human or an AI opponent.
- The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
- A heuristic evaluation function helps the AI make quicker decisions.
- Beautiful command-line interface for an engaging gaming experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git

2. Navigate to project directory:

   ```shell
   cd tic-tac-toe

3. Run the Game:

   ```shell
   python main.py

## How to Play
 - The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
 - You are "X," and the AI opponent is "O."
 - To make a move, enter the row and column where you want to place your "X."
 - The AI will then make its move, and the game continues until there's a winner or a draw.
  
## AI Strategy
  The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to explore all possible game states and select the move that maximizes its chances of winning or minimizing its chances of losing. It employs a heuristic evaluation function to speed up the decision-making process.

## Acknowledgments
  Special thanks to the creators of the Minimax algorithm, which made the AI unbeatable in this game.
